My understanding: 

===========
Exercise 1
===========

The codebase given uses single letters to describe varibales, which can be quite confusing to developers inheriting the code, better descriptive language has to be used to make the code idiomatic and scalable in effect. The prompt has improved the readibility of the code, making it easier to interpret, whilst maintaining its integrity, the style of writing and prime directive of the code have yet to change. 

===========
Exercise 2
===========

The main thing I got from the improvement is the separation of concerns. Refactoring the code has improved the flow of the code, making it easier for me as a dev to find where, tax, pricing and shipping protocols can be found the code.

===========
Exercise 3
===========

This section is straight forward. Duplicate loops have been removed, nothing more to it. A helper function has been placed in place of those multiloops
