My notes : 

Just a discliamer, certain exercises were heavily dependent on AI. Solely because I didn't quite understand what was required of me, as in the prime-diretive of the exercise. 

And I could have sent an email to the faciliator, but I am currently indispoed heavily due to registration isssues. So by the time I get to doing the execrises I either have a class that I need to attend or I have to sleep so that I can wake up to be on time to get to the financial office. 

With that being said, the most obviously opportunity for design pattern implementation is the large family of if and elif statements which can be replaced with a factory method. Due to its scalability and maintainability. It allows variations to be implemeneted on the database, without tampering with the code logic. 

Reflection:

Implementing the design pattern made the code more readible by creating seperation of concerns. One can clearly see what each object and method do, and how they are inherited and relate to other objects. The flow of the code is far better with this design pattern.

Future changes, the mist basic one that I can think of, is that it becomes easier to change database fields and inputs without disturbing the integrity of the code

The most difficult thng to understand about the code was Mongo and how one could connect to Mongo via Python.
